### Project Describtion 
-----------------------------
In this Project we are comming to decide whether the company `e-commerce` should launch the new web page or not

__Dataset shape__
----------------------------
This dataset has `294478` rows and `5` columns 

__Cleaning The Dataset__
--------------------------
This dataset has some wrong values which I cleaned 

The wrong values are that the `landing_page` for the `control` group must be with the value of `old_page`

and the `landing_page` for the `treatment` group must be `new_page`

__Conclusion__
--------------------------------------
After calculating the probabilities , performing A/B tests and performing Regression tests we come with the conclusion that the company __"e-commerce"__ 
should not implement the new page and just stick with the old page
